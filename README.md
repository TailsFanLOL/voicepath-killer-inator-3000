# ❗VoicePath Killer (real) (legit) (TESTED WORKING ANDROID 4.2 Jelly Bean MR1 > ANDROID 18.2 Crème Brûlée MR2!!!111!1!1 ✅✅✅2077)

hd discord call para android es real legit makes you sound like on iphone just add ios launcher by petya1977 on gogel play store

On a more serious note, this just toggles the prop `use.voice.path.for.pcm.voip` to off. It might or might not pair well with @reiryuki 's mic fix module, I don't know, haven't tested.  
Please, **DO NOT** install @PS2ClassicsVault 's "Audio-HD-Enhancer", regardless of if you are going to use *this* module or not.

Additionally, I release this into the public domain whereever possible. It is probably too trivial to be eligible for copyright in the first place anyway, however.  
This comes without any warranty, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## Installation
1. Zip up this repo (root of zip must contain `module.prop`). You can use the Download button on GitHub.
2. Open Magisk Manager → Modules → Install from file → select the zip.
3. Reboot.

## Notes
- Requires Magisk v20.0. Probably.
- Other modules might overwrite this (ahem, PS2ClassicsVault, ahem)
- Some guy on XDA forums said that the prop fixes audio not appearing at all in WhatsApp.
